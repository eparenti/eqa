## Recommendations

### Step sol: Run nfs-exports.yml

**Command**: `ansible-playbook nfs-exports.yml`

**Error**: ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'ansible.posix.firewalld'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/home/student/control-review/nfs-exports.yml': line 75, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    # Configure the firewall
    - name: Ensure firewall services are enabled
      ^ here


**Suggested Action**: Review the error message and verify the instruction step is correct.
