## Bugs Found

### [P1] Grading passed without solution (should fail)

**ID**: scale-review-P1-005

**Fix**: Review grading script to ensure it validates student work, not just checks if files exist

**Verification**:
- 1. Run 'lab grade' immediately after 'lab start'
- 2. Should fail
- 3. Fix grading logic
